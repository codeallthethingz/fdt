[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/codeallthethingz/food-diary-tracker.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/trackallthethingz/food-diary-tracker)

Tracking things you've done, and feelings you've had and the severity of them.  This is called a food diary, but you could use it for anything you 
want to try and correlate.

Stores results in a spreadsheet in your google drive account called "food-diary-data".  

We never see the details of your records.  We never log anything.

Creates autocomplete from a summary page created in your google sheet.
